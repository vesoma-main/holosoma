# Holosoma

Holosoma (Greek: "whole-body") is a comprehensive humanoid robotics framework for training and deploying reinforcement learning policies on humanoid robots, as well as motion retargeting. Supports locomotion (velocity tracking) and whole-body tracking tasks across multiple simulators (IsaacGym, IsaacSim, MJWarp, MuJoCo) with algorithms like PPO and FastSAC.

## Features

- **Multi-simulator support**: IsaacGym, IsaacSim, MuJoCo Warp (MJWarp), and MuJoCo (inference only)
- **Multiple RL algorithms**: PPO and FastSAC
- **Robot support**: Unitree G1 and Booster T1 humanoids
- **Task types**: Locomotion (velocity tracking) and whole-body tracking
- **Sim-to-sim and sim-to-real deployment**: Shared inference pipeline across simulation and real robot control
- **Motion retargeting**: Convert human motion capture data to robot motions while preserving interactions with objects and terrain
- **Wandb integration**: Video logging, automatic ONNX checkpoint uploads, and direct checkpoint loading from Wandb

## Documentation

- **[Training Guide](src/holosoma/README.md)** - Train locomotion and whole-body tracking policies in IsaacGym/IsaacSim
- **[Inference & Deployment Guide](src/holosoma_inference/README.md)** - Deploy policies to real robots or evaluate in MuJoCo simulation
- **[Retargeting Guide](src/holosoma_retargeting/README.md)** - Convert human motion capture data to robot motions

## Quick Start

### Setup

Choose the appropriate setup script based on your use case:

```bash
# For IsaacGym training
bash scripts/setup_isaacgym.sh

# For IsaacSim training
# Requires Ubuntu 22.04 or later due to IsaacSim dependencies
bash scripts/setup_isaacsim.sh

# For MJWarp training and MuJoCo simulation (inference)
bash scripts/setup_mujoco.sh

# For inference/deployment
bash scripts/setup_inference.sh

# For motion retargeting
bash scripts/setup_retargeting.sh
```

### Training

Train a G1 robot with FastSAC on IsaacGym:

```bash
source scripts/source_isaacgym_setup.sh
python src/holosoma/holosoma/train_agent.py \
    exp:g1-29dof-fast-sac \
    simulator:isaacgym \
    logger:wandb \
    --training.seed 1
```

> **Note:** For headless servers, see the [training guide](src/holosoma/README.md#video-recording) for video recording configuration.

See the [Training Guide](src/holosoma/README.md) for more examples and configuration options.

### Quick Demo

We provide scripts to run the complete pipeline: (data downloading and processing for LAFAN), retargeting, data conversion, and whole-body tracking policy training.

```bash
# Run retargeting and whole-body tracking policy training using OMOMO data
bash demo_scripts/demo_omomo_wb_tracking.sh

# Run retargeting and whole-body tracking policy training using LAFAN data
bash demo_scripts/demo_lafan_wb_tracking.sh
```

### Deployment & Evaluation

After training, deploy your policies:

- **Real Robot**: See [Real Robot Locomotion](src/holosoma_inference/docs/workflows/real-robot-locomotion.md) or [Real Robot WBT](src/holosoma_inference/docs/workflows/real-robot-wbt.md)
- **MuJoCo Simulation**: See [Sim-to-Sim Locomotion](src/holosoma_inference/docs/workflows/sim-to-sim-locomotion.md) or [Sim-to-Sim WBT](src/holosoma_inference/docs/workflows/sim-to-sim-wbt.md)

Or browse all deployment options in the [Inference & Deployment Guide](src/holosoma_inference/README.md).
